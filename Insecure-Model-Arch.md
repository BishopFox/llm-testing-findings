# Reliance on Insecure Model Architectures

## Description
Machine Learning (ML) models can harbor inherent design or architectural vulnerabilities, paralleling traditional software risks. Deploying these insecure architectures can compromise dependent systems.

## Extended Description
As ML/AI increasingly integrates with everyday activities and critical decision-making, ensuring model robustness is essential. Analogous to code vulnerabilities in software, ML models may possess flaws in their design, training, or structure that are exploitable or lead to undesired outcomes. These could stem from training phase oversights, susceptibility to adversarial exploits, or utilizing outdated models, all with potentially extensive repercussions.

## Potential Mitigations

- **Model Evaluation**: Routinely assess models for weaknesses with methods like adversarial testing.
- **Stay Updated**: Keep abreast of scholarly and industry updates on vulnerabilities in standard model architectures.
- **Architectural Review**: Critically analyze a model's architecture against industry benchmarks before deployment.
- **Retraining and Updating**: Consistently update and retrain models with current, secure data.
- **External Audits**: Engage in intermittent independent security reviews of ML architectures.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Establish alternative processes for continuity if a model malfunctions.

## Related Weaknesses

- **CWE-693**: Protection Mechanism Failure - Indicates a general security assurance deficiency.
- **CWE-664**: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime - Relevant if models lack ongoing maintenance or updates.

## Impact Analysis

- **System Vulnerabilities**: Inherent model flaws can render systems attack-prone.
- **Compromised Data Integrity**: Vulnerable models with write permissions might distort or damage data.
- **Unreliable Outputs**: Non-robust models may yield unreliable or incorrect results, affecting decision quality.
- **Operational Disruption**: A model's breakdown or breach can interrupt critical workflows.
- **Loss of Stakeholder Trust**: Observable inconsistencies or security gaps can diminish stakeholder confidence in the system or its managing entity.
