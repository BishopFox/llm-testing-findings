# Data Leakage Risks in ML/AI Systems

## Description
ML/AI systems are prone to data leakage, which can occur at various stages of data processing, model training, or output generation, leading to unintended exposure of sensitive or proprietary information.

## Extended Description
Data leakage in ML/AI systems encompasses more than unauthorized database access; it can occur subtly when models unintentionally expose information about their training data. For example, models that overfit may allow inferences about the data they were trained on, presenting challenging-to-detect risks of potential data breaches.

## Potential Mitigations

- **Data Masking and Encryption**: Protect data at rest and in transit with encryption and mask sensitive details when feasible.
- **Access Controls**: Deploy robust access control systems to ensure that only authorized personnel can reach sensitive data and models.
- **Regular Audits**: Carry out frequent audits of data access logs and model outputs to uncover any leaks.
- **Differential Privacy**: Apply noise to datasets or model outputs to prevent the re-identification of individual data points.
- **Data Minimization**: Limit the use of data to what's necessary for training and operations to minimize the risk of leakage.
- **Monitoring**: Set up real-time surveillance to identify abnormal data access patterns or potential security incidents.

- **CWE-359**: Exposure of Private Personal Information (PPI): Highlights the dangers of leaking personal data.

## Impact Analysis

- **Financial Impact**: Data breaches can lead to significant fines and are particularly costly in heavily regulated industries or areas with strict data protection laws.
- **Reputation Damage**: Trust issues stemming from data leaks can affect relationships with clients, partners, and the wider stakeholder community, potentially resulting in lost business.
- **Legal and Compliance Implications**: Non-compliance with data protection can lead to legal repercussions and sanctions.
- **Operational Impact**: Breaches may interrupt business operations, requiring extensive efforts to resolve and recover from the incident.
- **Intellectual Property Risks**: Leaks in certain fields could disclose proprietary methodologies or trade secrets, offering competitors unfair advantages.
