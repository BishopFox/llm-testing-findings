# Absence of Disclaimer in ML/AI Outputs

## Description
The ML/AI system provides outputs, predictions, or decisions without any accompanying disclaimer clarifying the potential limitations, uncertainties, or risks associated with the generated results. This absence might lead users to over-rely on the system's outputs without considering its inherent limitations or the context of its training data.

## Potential Mitigations

- **Disclaimers**: Always accompany ML/AI outputs with clear disclaimers that provide context for the generated results.
- **User Education**: Educate users on the potential risks and limitations associated with the AI/ML system's outputs.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: In applications where the risk of misinterpretation is high, consider including a human-in-the-loop to validate and contextualize AI outputs.

## Related Weaknesses

- **CWE-693**: Protection Mechanism Failure (This is a broad category, but the idea of not having a protection mechanism, such as a disclaimer, fits this CWE in a conceptual manner.)

## Impact Analysis
Absence of a disclaimer can lead to:

- **Misunderstanding**: Users might misunderstand the capabilities and limitations of the AI/ML system.
- **Over-reliance**: Users might over-rely on the system's outputs, potentially making critical decisions based solely on AI predictions.
- **Liability**: Organizations deploying the ML/AI system might face legal or reputational challenges if users feel they were misled by system outputs.
