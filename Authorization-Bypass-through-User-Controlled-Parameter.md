# Authorization-Bypass-through-User-Controlled-Parameter

## Description

Authorization Bypass Through User Controlled Parameter mainly occurs in transactional Natural Language Generation (NLG) Systems, such as e-commerce chatbots and other consumer facing LLMs. An external party can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating user-controlled parameters that affect significant functionality such as purchase price or quantity.

## Extended Description

LLMs or chatbots designed for secure transactions could behave unpredictably if a malicious actor manipulates parameters that determine critical values such as purchase price, quantity of an item, or transaction details. This type of failure to validate user inputs could result in unauthorized benefits to the attacker, such as purchasing at reduced prices, manipulating the quantity of items held, buying entire inventories for market manipulation, misdirecting transactions to other accounts, etc. This scenario could lead to financial losses, operational disruptions, and reputational damage.

## Potential Mitigations

- **Immutable Key Parameters**: Design the system to treat certain vital parameters as immutable to user input, such as item prices, identity information or other critical transaction details.
- **Input Verification**: Implement robust verification and authentication for all variable user-submitted parameters.
- **Transaction Validation**: Execute multiple checks throughout the transaction process before final validation and confirmation.
- **Access Control Policies**: Set up robust role-based access control. This limits the relationship between users and the parameters they can manipulate.
- **Alerting Mechanisms**: Develop robust detection systems to alert about abnormal behavior patterns that might indicate attempted vulnerability exploits promptly.

## Related Weaknesses

- **CWE-20**: Improper Input Validation: Not properly validating user-controlled parameters could enable attacker unauthorized benefits.
- **CWE-266**: Incorrect Privilege Assignment: If user roles are mistakenly provided with the ability to edit parameters they shouldn't control, they could change the systemâ€™s behavior to their advantage.
- **CWE-285**: Improper Authorization: This could occur if the system fails to correctly perform access checks, giving an attacker the opportunity to manipulate key parameters.

## Impact Analysis

- **Financial Impact**: Unauthorized manipulations such as purchasing at reduced prices, increasing the quantity of items held, or misdirecting transactions could result in financial losses for the business.
- **Operational Disruption**: Altering transaction parameters can lead to disruptions in the system's operations and could potentially burden the business by causing an increase in failed transactions, inventory inconsistency, etc.
- **Reputational Damage**: If vulnerabilities are exploited and become public knowledge, it can lead to damage to the organization's reputation. Trust from customers, partners, and stakeholders may be eroded.
- **Regulatory Risk**: If the system operates on regulated data, products, or services, a breach of transaction integrity may lead to scrutiny from regulatory bodies, potentially adding further financial and reputational impacts.
- **Potential for Market Manipulation**: In more severe cases, an attacker could potentially use this exploit to flood the market with discounted goods or create an artificial scarcity, destabilizing market conditions for the affected product or service.
