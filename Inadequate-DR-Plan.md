# Inadequate Disaster Recovery Plans for ML Systems

## Description
Machine Learning (ML) systems' integration into operational frameworks is crucial for business decision-making and automation. Lack of robust disaster recovery (DR) plans exposes these systems to extended outages, risking data loss and service disruptions.

## Extended Description
ML/AI ecosystems, which encompass data pipelines, training regimens, and inferencing processes, can be significantly impacted by disasters, hardware malfunctions, cyberattacks, or software errors. The absence of a detailed DR strategy, specifically designed for ML intricacies, makes system restoration a daunting and fallible task.

## Potential Mitigations

- **DR Documentation**: Create a comprehensive DR plan detailing steps for ML system restoration, with regular updates as the system evolves.
- **Regular Drills**: Conduct disaster simulations to evaluate and refine recovery procedures.
- **Backup Routines**: Systematically backup all data, models, and settings in secure, diversified locations.
- **Failover Systems**: Establish redundant or cloud-based systems for immediate switchover during primary system failures.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Utilize tools to promptly detect and address anomalies or failures, with automatic recovery or alerts.
- **Training**: Train staff thoroughly on DR protocols.

## Related Weaknesses

- **CWE-688**: Function Call With Incorrect Variable or Reference as Argument - Indicative of potential system errors.
- **CWE-255**: Credentials Management - Critical for managing secure ML pipelines and data access during recovery.

## Impact Analysis

- **Operational Disruption**: Extended outages can severely interrupt business processes and continuity.
- **Data Loss**: Insufficient backup measures risk losing vital training data, model insights, or configurations.
- **Financial Consequences**: System downtime can inflict financial damage due to halted services or operations.
- **Reputation Damage**: Inability to quickly recover ML systems can undermine stakeholder confidence.
- **Compliance Violations**: Non-compliant DR strategies may breach regulatory standards, attracting fines or legal repercussions.
